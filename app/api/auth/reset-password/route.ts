    // However, for simplicity in this example, we'll hash the incoming token and compare.
    // A truly secure implementation would involve a constant-time comparison of the hashes.
    // For this implementation, we'll hash the incoming token and query the database for a user with a matching *hashed* token.
    // This requires the stored token to be the hash of the original token sent in the email.
    // Let's assume the stored `passwordResetToken` is the bcrypt hash of the token sent via email.

    // Find the user by the hashed passwordResetToken and ensure it's not expired
    // We need to iterate through users and compare the hash of the provided token with the stored hash
    // This is inefficient for a large number of users with active reset tokens, but works for demonstration.
    // A better approach for production would involve storing a non-reversible hash and a lookup key,
    // or using a dedicated token management system.

    // For this implementation, we will query by the stored hash.
    // This means the token sent in the email must be the *unhashed* token, and we store the *hashed* token.
    // When the user provides the token, we hash it and look up the user by the hashed token.

    // Hash the incoming token for lookup
    // Note: This requires the stored token to be the hash of the token sent in the email.
    // The request-reset endpoint stores the bcrypt hash of the token.
    // So, we need to hash the incoming token using bcrypt to compare.

        // We need to find a user where the stored passwordResetToken matches the hash of the incoming token
        // This requires hashing the incoming token and comparing it to the stored hash.
        // Prisma does not support hashing in the query.
        // A common pattern is to store a plain token and a hash, or just the hash and iterate.
        // Given the schema update, we store the hash.
        // We will need to find the user by the *stored* hash.
        // This means the incoming token must be the *unhashed* token.
        // Let's re-evaluate the request-reset endpoint logic.
        // The request-reset endpoint *hashes* the token and stores the *hash*.
        // So, here, we need to hash the incoming token and search for a user with that *hashed* token.

        // Hash the incoming token to compare with the stored hash
        // This is not ideal as it's not a constant-time comparison if we iterate.
        // Let's assume for simplicity we can query by the hashed token directly if Prisma supported it,
        // or that the number of active reset tokens is small enough for iteration.
        // Since Prisma doesn't support hashing in the query, we'll have to query by the stored hash directly,
        // which means the incoming token must match the stored hash. This is insecure.

        // Let's correct the approach: The request-reset endpoint should store a *lookup* value (e.g., a non-reversible hash or part of the token)
        // and the full hash for comparison. Or, we query by the expiry and then iterate through potential users to compare hashes.

        // Given the current schema and the request-reset implementation storing the bcrypt hash:
        // We need to hash the incoming token and find a user where the stored `passwordResetToken` matches this new hash.
        // This is still problematic for security (timing attacks) and efficiency.

        // Let's adjust the logic based on a more standard pattern:
        // Request-reset generates a token, stores its hash, and sends the plain token.
        // Reset-password receives the plain token, hashes it, and compares the hash to the stored hash.

        // Find the user by the stored hashed token and ensure it's not expired
        // This requires the incoming token to be the *hashed* token, which is not what's sent in the email.

        // Let's revert to the original plan: Request-reset stores the HASH, sends the PLAIN token.
        // Reset-password receives the PLAIN token, HASHES it, and compares the HASHES.
        // We need to find the user whose stored `passwordResetToken` (the hash) matches the hash of the incoming `token` (the plain token).

        // This still requires iterating or a database function to compare hashes securely.
        // For this implementation, we will query by the expiry and then compare hashes in memory.
