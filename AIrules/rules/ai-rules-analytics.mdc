# AI Rules Analytics

Each time you use an AI rule, update the analytics tracking file.

File location:
```
PROJECT_ROOT/AIrules/analytics.md
```

## Format

The analytics file contains a count of how many times each rule has been used:

```
rule-name.mdc: 5
another-rule.mdc: 2
```

Add new rules as needed.
