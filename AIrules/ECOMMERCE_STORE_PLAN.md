## Implementation Plan

### Project Architecture

The e-commerce platform will follow a modern architecture pattern with:

1. **Next.js App Router**: Utilizing the latest Next.js features including server components, route handlers, and middleware.

2. **Database Layer**: PostgreSQL with Neon for serverless SQL, accessed through Prisma ORM.

3. **Authentication Layer**: NextAuth.js with JWT tokens and session management.

4. **State Management**: Zustand for client-side state, React Query for server state.

5. **UI Components**: ShadCN UI with Tailwind CSS for consistent design system.

6. **API Structure**: REST API endpoints built using Next.js API routes.

### Database Schema Overview

The core entities in the database will include:

1. **User**: Customer and admin accounts with role-based permissions
2. **Product**: Complete product information including variants
3. **Category**: Hierarchical product categorization
4. **Order**: Order details with line items and status
5. **Cart**: Shopping cart items for users
6. **Payment**: Payment transaction records
7. **Address**: Shipping and billing addresses
8. **Review**: Product reviews and ratings
